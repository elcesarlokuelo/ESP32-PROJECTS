# ESP32-PROJECTS
Hello there!
In this repository I will be uploading all the different projects that I develop in the ESP32 DEVKIT V1 platform.
From the easiest, more beginner projects, to ideally the more difficult. Trying to use all the capabilities of the microcontroller.  

The program used for coding and compiling is the Arduino IDE, using the ESP32 library.
